Approach
​
so do this problem in less time we can use the floyd warshall cycle for this we have to take the two poiinters which can be slow and  fast pointers and then the next will be the index of the value and then we go like this omly
​
​
so in this what we do is that we will do the first we have to take two pointers which is slow and fast pointers the slow pointers will will move one step and fast pointer will move the two step and then this methord users the linked list cycle methord if there is any cycle in then it means that it will contain a duppiacte the dupliacte tjat we havr to return.
​
so in this we have to point the slow nad fast pointers first in the nums[0 then we have to move to the slow by one step means that we have to move to the nums[slow] the slow will be in the slow=nms[slow  which is the starting the this will continye until we make the loop
